  {Jan '22 - Apr '22}
  {
    \begin{cvitems}
    \item Implemented text summarization algorithms like \textbf{TextRank, LSA}, seq2seq architectures like \textbf{Google PEGASUS, t5-small}
    % \item Over 230k news articles from both Hindi and English were included in the Text Corpora, along with their own human-written summaries
    \item Preprocessed text corpora using a varity of \textbf{NLP techniques} like \textbf{tokenization, stemming, lemmetization}
    \item Used \textbf{ROUGE-N score} to evaluate accuracy of the algorithm summaries against human summaries for \textbf{corpus of size 230k}
    % \item Tested out all the algorithms on both Hindi and English language datasets and achieved SOTA f1-scores on our datasets for both abstractive algorithms after fine tuning
    \item Tested out algorithms and \textbf{achieved SOTA f1-scores} on our datasets for both abstractive algorithms \textbf{after fine tuning}
    % \item Worked in a 5 person team to do all the research, presentation and implementation work
    \item Created a \textbf{Flask web application} for users to interact with the algorithms and get summaries of articles or blogs%in Hindi and English languages

  {Aug '21 - Nov '21}
  {
    \begin{cvitems}
    \item Analysed vaccination rates for \textbf{covid-19 by race in US counties}, along with their association with socioeconomic status and other factors, using a number of statistical techniques
    \item Transformed and pre-processed data by \textbf{z-score} normalization and \textbf{PCA} dimension reduction of feature matrix
    \item Implemented variety of regression algorithms like \textbf{MLR, Lasso-Ridge-Elastinet Regression, SVR, Random Forest}
    \item \textbf{Fine tuned} the hyper parameters of these algorithms using train and test \textbf{MSE as metric} of measure
    % \item Found Covid-19 1st-dose rates in US counties to be significantly affected by socioeconomic status and political ideology

  {Aug '21 - Nov '21}
  {
    \begin{cvitems}
    \item Analysed \textbf{seasonal crop data} for last 20 years and unearthed surprising information about the Indian agricultural
    % \item Collected around 2.5 lakh data points from data-gov servers using multiple API calls
    \item Pre-processed 2.5 lakh data points using \textbf{cleaning techniques} to get robust dataset for subsequent steps
    \item Developed new categorical variables of zones and crop to make analysis more understandable and comparative
    \item Used \textbf{geopandas} library to discover the geographical situation of Indian agriculture on zone and crop basis
    % \item Unearthed some unexpected information regarding the Indian agricultural state
    \end{cvitems}

  {Sep '20 - Nov '20}
  {
    \begin{cvitems}
      \item Modeled a \textbf{seasonal ARIMA model} to forecast next years temperatures based on historical data 
      % \item Obtained monthly average temperatures for India during the past 117 years in Celsius from data-gov website
      \item Checked data stationarity through \textbf{Dickey-Fuller test}, and performed seasonal differencing to ensure stationary TS
      \item Optimized the model parameters using \textbf{Box Jenkins Method} for forecasting purposes
      \item Performed residual analysis and \textbf{information criterion tests} to check model adequacy on the dataset
      \item Yielded absolute \textbf{MAE of 2.2\%} on test data for optimized S-ARIMA model
